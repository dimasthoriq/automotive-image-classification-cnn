# About
This is the code developed for my student-intern research, Image Classification For Automotive Assembling Plant Visual Inspection Task Using Convolutional Neural Network. This code is for academic purpose only and the paper report is not to be published whatsoever. The research purpose is to develop models that are capable to classify the model variant of the car, the paint color of the car, and whether it has a side mirror or not, given some image of a car. The model for color classification didnt perform well, supposedly due to imbalanced data as it was collected from limited resource. The other models performed better relatively, but is still missing the bounding box to locate the detected feature.

I will provide both the notebook and python file, in case you would want to see the results directly from github page
